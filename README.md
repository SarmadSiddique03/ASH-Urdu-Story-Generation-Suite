## üß© System Modules

### 1. üåê Client Interface Module (Frontend)
A responsive React.js web application that allows users to:

- Submit prompts for Urdu story generation using either Finetuned or RAG models.
- View generated Urdu stories.
- Provide input for generating videos based on stories or prompts.
- Monitor the status and progress of video generation.
- Interact with an intelligent chatbot.
- Access generated videos and chatbot responses.

This is where users lands on startup.

### 2. ‚úçÔ∏è Finetuned Story Generation Module
Generates Urdu stories using a **finetuned LLaMA 3.2 8B** model.

- Accepts user prompt and returns a generated Urdu story.
- Hosted on Colab with ngrok tunneling.
- The ngrok URL must be added to the backend config for story generation.

### 4. üéûÔ∏è Static Video Generation Module (Colab)
Converts Urdu stories into narrated animated videos.

- Parses stories into scene descriptions using Gemini.
- Generates visuals with **Stable Diffusion XL**.
- Adds narration with **Google Text-to-Speech (Urdu)**.
- Combines everything into a final stitched video.

> **How to Run:**
> - Run the `Static-B.ipynb` notebook (on a Colab T4 GPU). It will display an ngrok URL (port exposed).
> - Copy that ngrok URL into `Static-A.ipynb` and run it.
> - The final ngrok URL from Static-A is then used in the backend.

### 5. üåÄ Fluid Video Generation Module (Colab & Scalable)
Creates dynamic videos from a single prompt, combining narration, visuals, and background music.

- Parses prompt and generates image/music descriptions using Gemini.
- Distributes image generation tasks to multiple Colab "B" workers.
- Each worker runs on a separate Colab T4 instance and exposes a port using ngrok.
- Uses **MusicGen Small** for background music.
- Combines assets into a video with narration.

> **How to Run:**
> - Launch up to N Colab notebooks for `Fluid-B.ipynb` (scalable workers). Each displays its ngrok URL.
> - Copy all worker URLs into `Fluid-A.ipynb` and run it (also on Colab with ngrok).
> - Use the final Fluid-A ngrok URL in the backend for endpoint communication.

### 6. ü§ñ Chatbot Module
A bilingual chatbot (Urdu/English) trained to answer questions about Urdu literature and history.

- Maintains session context.
- Performs real-time web search using DuckDuckGo Search API when needed.
- Powered by Gemini for intelligent, contextual answers.
